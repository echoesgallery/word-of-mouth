    "description": "Word Of Mouth collection is in short 'therapy' though art. As loosing the use of my hand motivated me to use art to regain it. In the 'therapy' you have the space to 'donate' an image or selfie with the word that best describes you. The word is like a complement to oneself there for helping you in this 'therapy'. Think about covering a small part of your face. Use the artist within yourself to choose what to cover and the word, then leave the rest to the imagination of the viewer.",
